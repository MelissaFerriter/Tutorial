WDE is the system we use to receive and make calls and to own cases. Here are some tips:

* When you open up WDE, you should set voice and email to "Not Ready" and log off of chat. Once you set voice and email to ready, you are open to taking calls and email cases
* If you are having issues logging into WDE check to make sure you are connected to the VPN
* Calls will come through Skype for Business so make sure you always have that running in the background. You will see the customer information appear on the right side of WDE and you will accept the call by the green button on the Skype pop-up; you also have the option to send the call straight to voicemail if you are unable to answer
* When a case comes through over the phone or on email, you will see a series of buttons next to the customer's name
* If you receive a phone case that needs to be transferred, take some notes from the customer, save them in the notes section, explain that you will be transferring to __ team, write "RR to _" in the notes section, and then transfer the case to Reception 
* To fully own a case, you need to own it in WDE and not just Salesforce
* Email cases will bounce from your queue in 1 hour if you do not own them 
* During your SPEC shift if you need to set your status to "Not Ready", log a SPEC exception if the time exceeds 15 minutes. Setting to "Not Ready" will affect you availability metric 
* Within WDE you can start a consultation with Sales, Customer Service, or Reception; this is useful if you need to ask them a question or transfer the customer to one of those teams
