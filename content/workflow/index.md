#### 1. Make Initial Contact

##### Phone
>"Hi this is __ , am I speaking with __? "

##### Email
>"Thank you for contacting Esri Support. My name is __, and I have taken ownership of your case #xxxxxxx and will be assisting you to a resolution.
I understand you are experiencing some challenges with __."


#### 2. Log a Call

![4]

>Keep in mind that the customer can see what you post in the call log. Some common details to include are whether a screenshare was performed, the duration of the call, and if the call came in over SPEC.

#### 3. Send a Follow-Up Email

![5]

>A good follow up email will contain a summary of what was discussed and any related documentation that would be helpful to the customer. Be sure to include your contact information in the email after a first phone call. 

#### 4. Post Your Call Notes

![6]

>A call notes post is like a stream of consciousness recollection of everything that happened during the call. 

#### 5. Troubleshoot the Issue

>Coming to a resolution often involves a lot of research, testing, and collaborating. Start by searching for similar cases, defects, or knowledge article in Salesforce. It is always a good idea to utilize the epxertise of your colleagues as well by reaching out over Teams or posting in the SWARM groups in Salesforce. 

#### 6. Confirm That You Can Close the Case

![7]

>Reach out the customer, either over the phone or email, and confirm that they have no further questions and would like to close the case. If you are closing from non-response, the rule of thumb is to reach out 3 times over email and twice over the phone before sending them an email stating you are closing the case. You can also give the customer the option to "temporarily close" and then reopen when they have more time for troubleshooting. 

#### 7. Write Your Case Summary

![8]

>The case summary should ideally be the last post in the case and should detail the issue, environment, troublshooting approach, documentation, and resolution.

#### 8. Update the Case Title

![9]

>Always update the case title before closing out the case. Often the issue changes over time and the original title may not accurately capture the case topic. 

#### 9. Update the Technical Details

![10]

>Here you will need to fill out the product and product version.
#### 10. Categorize the Case

![11]

>When you categorize a case you will need to fill out the product area, functionality, and issue. 

#### 11. Close the Case

![12]

>To close a case, you will need to select a Primary Resolution and Secondary Resolution.
