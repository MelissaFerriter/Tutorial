title: Case Summaries 101

>Case summaries help other analysts looking through your case quickly see your troubleshooting steps, enviornment, and conclusion. If their customer is having a similar issue, a good case summary can save them a lot of time. Detailing what didn't work for you is often as important as detailing what did work. 
<!--more-->

#### **Essential Elements**
* Description of the issue
* Description of the environment
* Any testing or research performed and what eventually worked
* The final resolution
* Any documentation you used or sent to the customer
* Next steps in the case

##### This is the format I use 

![2]

It includes sections for:  
* Issue  
* Environment
* Testing/Research
* Documentation
* Next Steps

>I like to continually update the same post as the case progresses by selecting the option to "edit in chatter". Before I close my case out, I will copy the post and paste it into a brand new post so that it is at the very top of the case feed. I will then usually delete the old post to avoid having a duplicate. Customers will occassionally reopen old cases, so the case summary can also serve as a reminder of where you left off.

This case #02644500 went on for quite some time so you can see that my case summary is quite long.
